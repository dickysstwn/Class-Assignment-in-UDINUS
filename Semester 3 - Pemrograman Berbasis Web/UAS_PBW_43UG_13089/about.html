        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>DS Project is a gallery to accommodate photos or videos that I have created. More than that, here I will explain about the meaning and intent of the photo or video. Here, I will also give a little leak about tips and tricks that are easy on certain photos or videos so that you can all try it.</p>
        <p2>On the other hand, the purpose of the DS Project is none other than to provide an overview and motivation that sees that the world of photography and videography is not just shooting, recording, and then producing images or videos. In a work it contains efforts and moments that cannot be repeated. In every moment it is certainly better if there is documentation, because the fact is we want every good moment, new thing, or event on that day can be remembered to be a story even evidence in the future.</p2>
